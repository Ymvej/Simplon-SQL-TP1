# Simplon-SQL-TP1

import.sql - creates database and initial table and imports the csv into it.


main.sql - main work. 5 & 11 have not been done due to me not having time and frankly, not wanting to do them. Eveyrthing is commented. Actual comments are double commented, so you can just select all and uncomment to have linting, or uncomment each block to test.
